**CS-2413 Programming Data Structures and Abstractions:**
---------------------------------------------------------
**Project 1:** Demonstrates the ability to implement seach, sort, removal and insertion functions on dynamic arrays.

**Project 2:** Demostrates the ability to implement a basic class for handling tabular data, such as reading data from a CSV file, sorting the table, searching for records, and performing various operations on the table.

**Project 3:** Demostrates the ability to implement a basic blockchain structure with classes for transactions, blocks, and the blockchain itself. The transaction class defines attributes like transaction ID, source and 
target IDs, amount, and timestamp, while the block class represents a block with its number, current transactions, and a vector of transactions. The blockChain class manages the blockchain as a linked list of blocks, 
allowing insertion of transactions. If a block is full, a new block is created. The main function initializes the blockchain, reads user input for transaction details, and inserts them into the blockchain. Finally, the 
program displays the current state of the blockchain, including the number of blocks, block numbers, and transaction details within each block.

**Project 4:** Demonstrates the ability to implement a simulation of a decentralized network with multiple nodes, each hosting its own blockchain to record financial transactions. The program defines classes for transactions, blocks, blockchains, and a network of blockchains. Transactions involve source and target IDs, transaction amounts, timestamps, and initial funds for both parties. The code creates a network with a specified number of nodes, each initialized with a blockchain, and then inserts this blockchain into all nodes. Subsequently, the program reads transaction details for each node, inserting them into the corresponding blockchain. Finally, the code displays the current state of the entire network, showcasing the blocks and transactions in each blockchain. This simulation allows for the exploration of decentralized financial transactions within a networked environment.
